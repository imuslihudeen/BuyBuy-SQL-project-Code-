# Insights

- There was a slight increase in the profit made by Buybuy in the Q2 between 2011-2012, however there was slight decline in the following year 2013. The year 2014 experienced the one of highest sales in Q2. There was an enormous decline in 2015, however there was rapid improvement in 2016 which has the highest profit for Q2, and this can be maintained through teamwork and effort and provision of incentive to worker i.e. leaves, Bonuses etc.

- The united states ranked as the country with the highest sales while the United Kingdom has the lowest sales. Resource need to be focused more in the United Kingdom where sales was the lowest among the top 3 countries, and BuyBuy company should also increase its sales of accessories with more adverts, promotions to educate people on the wide range of product in which you sell including accessories.
